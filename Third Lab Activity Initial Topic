Video Streaming Platforms (e.g., Netflix)
Why speed matters:
Millions of users stream simultaneously; buffering must be minimal.

Data Parallelism:

Video files are chunked and distributed across servers.
Encoding happens in parallel for different segments.

Task Parallelism:

Authentication service
Recommendation engine
Video transcoding
Content delivery
Each service runs independently.
